// console.log('vaish ' + 'Surya') //vaish surya it gives space between vaish nd surya bcoz i have given space in ' ' after vaish otherwise the output would be vaishsurya without space in between



/* ternary operator --> returns the value based on the condition */

//const isEven = 10 % 2 === 0 ? true : false // true (condition evaluates first)
const isEven = 10 % 2 === 0 ? 'Number is even' : 'Number is odd' // number is even (without writing in '' had given error)
console.log(isEven)
